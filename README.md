# VR Scenario: Designing Safe Clinical Decision Support (CDS)

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project develops a **10-minute immersive VR training module** for students in **health informatics and nursing**, simulating a medication administration workflow where **flawed CDS logic** and **inconsistent data handling** create dangerous clinical errors.  

Learners experience both **passive observation** and **active problem-solving**, ultimately reflecting on how to design safer, standards-driven CDS systems.  

**Core Theme:**  
Misinterpreted guidelines, poor data structures, and over-alerting can create **false positives**, **alert fatigue**, and **unsafe practices**. This VR experience teaches how small design flaws can have large impacts on patient safety.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
By the end of this VR scenario, students will be able to:

- 🔍 **Analyze Real-World Impact** – Recognize how flawed CDS design can compromise safety.  
- 📊 **Recognize Data Standards** – Understand the role of structured formats (e.g., FHIR) in reliable systems.  
- 🚨 **Understand Alert Fatigue** – Experience how excessive/irrelevant alerts reduce trust.  
- ✍️ **Identify Data Entry Risks** – Observe how unstructured free-text introduces vulnerabilities.  
- 💡 **Practice Guideline Implementation** – Apply safer CDS logic to prevent errors.
